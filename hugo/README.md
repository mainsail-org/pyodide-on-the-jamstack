# Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator. For getting started with Hugo, see:
- [Hugo's GitHub repo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/)

This project uses `hugo >= v0.85.0+`.

## Goals

Setup a hugo project that lets an author create a Python-enabled static site.

These are some thing that an author could do without having to learn Javascript:
- [ ] write prose in markdown
- [ ] write math with TeX
- [ ] load pyodide from a CDN
- [ ] load python code snippets from a python file
- [ ] load python code snippets and outputs from a Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] edit and execute code snippets in the browser
- [ ] use pyodide packages like numpy and pandas in the browser
- [ ] run asynchronous python code
- [ ] run python code in a service worker
- [ ] publish a Python-enabled site to the web, at no cost
